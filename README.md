# Petroleum Products produced in India from 2020-2023
The data has been fetched from the API provided by the Governmnet of India on their website(data.gov.in). 

The data has been fetched using an API and it contains 492 rows and 5 columns.

## Overview
The data contains columns like Month, Year, Product, Quantity produced (in metric tonnes) and updated date.

## Goal
The goal of the project was to derive insights from the Petroleum products data to find out their production variation across the 4 years (2020 - 2023).

## Dataset Details
Size : 492 rows and 5 columns

API endpoint : https://api.data.gov.in/resource/7b624b4a-1456-4945-80d0-dfb5e40ddcff

## EDA Summary

### Main Findings
Some of the main findings are as follows:
1. Identification of the number of unique products produced by Refineries & Fractionators
2. Count occurances of each of those products.
3. Identify the most and least produced product along the 4 years.
4. Year wise production.
5. Idnetify which products have been produced the most and the least both during the years which witnessed maximum and minimum production.

### Data Pre Processing
Out of the five columns fetched as a response from above API, only one column(**updated_date**) was dropped as it didn't have much significance in generating the insights.

### Visualizations and Analysis
Bar graphs and line graphs have been used for visualization.
